### RGSciences

This was originally a clone project of the [RGSciences](https://esg.rgsciences.com/) website. The clone was built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, the aim was to achieve the same functionality and appearance as the original website, but with potentially different technical tools and enhancements.

Later, I expanded the existing project with two portfolio databases, which I processed in the "Platform" route. I chose solutions from ApexCharts to create the graphs. The processed data show the effects of each company's "green effort" on the given portfolio.

#### Project Details

- **Original Website**: [RGSciences](https://esg.rgsciences.com/)
- **Project Duration**: Completed within four days (original project)

#### Further Development

- **Data Migration**: Consider migrating data to Firebase or Sanity.io for enhanced scalability and maintainability.
- **Additional Features**: Explore adding new features or enhancements to improve user experience and functionality.
- **Additional routes**: Create more pages in order to discover deeper relationships between data.
- **File Upload Option**: Although there is a backend path for data fetching (the app can handle any number of existing portfolios), it can be a good further development if the user could upload their own portfolio.

#### Features

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs quickly.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity.
- **Additional Libraries**: Integration of additional libraries like AOS, React Share, React Select, Sweetalert2, Swiper, React Parallax Tilt, ApexCharts and more for enhanced functionality.
